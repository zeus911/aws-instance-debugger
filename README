# AWS Instance Debugger

Open source tool that generate a bunch more of CloudWatch metrics for your AWS instance. Mostly used in SolrCloud instances

## Application Checklist

  - [ ] Sonar
  - [ ] Jenkins
  - [X] [Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aws-instance-debugger)
  
## Configuring project

You will need to use an Python 2.7 interpreter.

The easiest route is to create an Virtualenv with

`make virtualenv`

This will install all dependencies from `requirements.txt` automagically.

[**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

Just import the project and set the python path to the previously created [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) (`venv` folder).

## How to Run

This tool is a simle CLI. To check if everything is set up correctly, simply run it using the `venv` python:

`./venv/bin/python vivareal/aws_instance_debugger.py`

**Running into your IDE (debug)**

Just open the module `vivareal/aws_instance_debugger.py` and run it directly from inside the IDE. 

## How to Test

`make test`

## How to Deploy

This package should be installed inside the AMI that you need to monitor, using `pip`.

`pip install aws_instance_debugger`

After that, make this tool run at the AMI boot, using your preferred method. I prefer using [supervisor](http://supervisord.org/).
